//! Limiting clients' ability to reuse tokens from NEW_TOKEN frames

/// [_RFC 9000 § 8.1.4:_](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9000.html#section-8.1.4)
///
/// > Attackers could replay tokens to use servers as amplifiers in DDoS attacks. To protect
/// > against such attacks, servers MUST ensure that replay of tokens is prevented or limited.
/// > Servers SHOULD ensure that tokens sent in Retry packets are only accepted for a short time,
/// > as they are returned immediately by clients. Tokens that are provided in NEW_TOKEN frames
/// > (Section 19.7) need to be valid for longer but SHOULD NOT be accepted multiple times.
/// > Servers are encouraged to allow tokens to be used only once, if possible; tokens MAY include
/// > additional information about clients to further narrow applicability or reuse.
///
/// `TokenLog` pertains only to tokens provided in NEW_TOKEN frames.
